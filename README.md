# 100 Days of Swift UI

## Section Overview
### Introduction
- This section was mostly centered on learning the basics of the Swift programming language
- For the most part my experience with other programming languages translated over to Swift
- Notable exceptions were Optionals and the way Protocols and Extensions are used in Swift

### Starting SwiftUI
- While I learned a bit of iOS programming as a hobby, that was mostly centered on UIKit, so the section was the first time I really learned more about SwiftUI
- The main focus was on learning basic view types like __Stacks__, __NavigationView__, __Forms__ and how to make use of the concept that views are a function of their state
- Other important aspects were how to use __buttons__, showing __alerts__
- Lastly, in the technique project I learned more about how views and viewmodifiers work under the hood, why structs are used for most things and why 'some View' is used so much

### Expanding your skills
- After the first section I was able to easily create basic UI's and now this section focused on expanding my knowledge of all the views SwiftUI offers
- I learned about __Stepper__, __DatePicker__ and __List__ views, got to know a bit of machine learning with __Create ML__ and learned how to work with dates in Swift
- Additionally I got more practice with __@State__, __Alert__ and __NavigationView__ and also learned how to load resources from the bundle
- In the technique project I learned about animations and how easy it can be to animate changes in state

### Scaling up to bigger apps
- After the last two sections I was able to create simple apps that can do simple things in a short time, now this chapter focused on the things that are needed to create bigger apps
- I learned about a new form of sharing state with __@ObservedObject__, how to show/hide views, delete items from lists, storing user settings and archiving objects
- I also got more in-depth knowledge of why __@State__ only works with structs, how to work with hierachical Codable data and how to push views on the navigation stack
- Additionally I learned about __GeometryReader__, __ScrollView__ and how to create custom __Paths__ and __Shapes__ in SwiftUI

### Focus on data

### Views and View controllers

### Controlling UI Flow

### One last project
