## Entering numbers with Stepper
- one of the ways SwiftUI lets users enter numbers is by using a **Stepper** view
- the other option would be a __Slider__, which is less precise
- Steppers can adapt to any kind of number they are bound to
- to limit the values of a stepper a range is used `Stepper(value: $var, in: 1...10) {...}`
- another useful parameter for steppers is the step value `Stepper(..., step: 0.25) {...}`
