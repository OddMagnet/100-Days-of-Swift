## Creating implicit animations
- are the simplest type of animation, they just tell the view how to respond if something tries to animate it
- this can be achieved by giving the view the `.animation()` modifier
- when any of the views modifier change - like padding, frame, scale, blur, etc - SwiftUI will automatically animate the change
- this allows for the animation to become a function of the apps state, just like views themselves
