- building lists with **@FetchRequest**
- sorting fetch requests with **NSSortDescriptor**
- deleting from a Core Data fetch request
- poping a Navigationlink programmatically

## [Project 12 - CoreDataProject](Project%2012)
A technique project to explore how Core Data and SwiftUI work together

Learning goals:
- why \.self works for ForEach
- **NSManagedObject** subclasses
- conditional saving of NSManagedObjectContext
- ensuring Core Data objects are unique using constraints
- filtering @FetchRequests using **NSPredicate**
- dynamically filtering @FetchRequests
- one-to-many relationshipes with Core Data, SwiftUI and @FetchRequest
