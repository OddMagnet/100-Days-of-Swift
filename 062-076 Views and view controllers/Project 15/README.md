## Identifying views with labels
- to make use of the VoiceOver feature, views need to be provided with the `.accessibility()` modifier
- this modifier takes a variety of (single) arguments, for example `label` which is a string that will be read when the view is selected
- `hint` will be read with a short delay after label and is used to provide additional details
- some other useful argument are `addTraits` and `removeTraits` which are used to tell VoiceOver that something does or does not have specific traits (e.g. an image also being a button)
