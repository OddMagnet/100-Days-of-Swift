# Layout and geometry
A technique project to learn about how SwiftUI handles layout and geometry.

## How layout works in SwiftUI
- to make the layout happen, SwiftUI takes 3 simple steps
- A parent view proposes a size for its child
- The child chooses its own size
- The parent positions the child in itself
- technically a fourth step happens, the rounding of pixels to their nearest value, so graphics remain sharp
- for a good example, see `Layout.swift` in the project
