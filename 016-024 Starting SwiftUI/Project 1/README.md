## Xcode
- *AppDelegate.swift* contains code for  managing the app, it was common to add code there, but not anymore
- *SceneDelegate.swift* contains code for launching one window in the app, mostly important for iPad where multiple windows can be open
- *ContentView.swift* contains the initial user interface (UI) of the app
- *Assets.xcassets* is an _asset catalog_, a collection of assets to be used in an app
- *LaunchScreen.storyboard* is a visual editor for the launchscreen
- *Info.plist* contains a collection of special values that describe to the system how the app works, which version it is, which orientations are supported and more
- *Preview Content* is a group containing *Preview Assests.xcassets*, another asset catalog specifically for images to use when designing the UI
