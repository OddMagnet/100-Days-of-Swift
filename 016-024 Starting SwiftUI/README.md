# 100 Days of Swift - Day 16 to 24 - Starting SwiftUI

## [Project 1 - WeSplit](Project%201)
This project is a check-sharing app that calculates how to split a check based on the number of people and how much tip you want to leave.

Learning goals:
- understanding basic SwiftUI app structure
- creating forms
- adding navigation bars
- modifying program state
- binding state to user interface controls
- creating views in a loop

## [Challenge Day](Challenge%20Day)
This project is the first challenge to build an app based purely on requirements, some suggestions were:
- Temperature conversion between Celsius, Fahrenheit or Kelvin
- **Length conversion**
- Time conversion
- Volume conversion

I chose _length conversion_ simply because that's what would be most useful to me personally since I often encounter non-metric measurements when browsing the web


## [Project 2 - GuessTheFlag](Project%202)
This project is a guessing game that helps the user learn some of the many flags of the world

Learning goals:
- using stacks to arrange views
- colors and frames
- gradients
- buttons and images
- showing alert messages

## [Project 3 - ViewsAndModifiers](Project%203)
A technique project to explore certain SwiftUI features in detail

Learning goals:
- how do views and view modifiers work
- why does SwiftUI use structs for its views
- why is 'some View' used so much
